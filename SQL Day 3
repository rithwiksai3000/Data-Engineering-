Hadoop vs Spark 

Hadoop and Apache Spark are two of the most popular distributed processing frameworks

Hadoop architecture: HDFS and Map & Reduce

HDFS ( Hadoop Distributed File System ) ----> Master slave archi
Eg: 1 gb file HDFS , distributed in multiple files of small parts ( 100mb)
To facilitate all these nodes , HDFS uses Yarn architecture
Uses name node and data node ---> Holds meta data of file


Mao & Reduce : Map gives the count od each word like NLP , and Reduce increases the count if the word repeats

Map : x= x^2 , if x=[1,2,3,4,5] ,
then o/p = [1,4,9,16,25] ---> Mapping o/p to get list of values

Reduce: [1,2,3,4,5]
X= Sum() , 
then X=15 , reduce the value to get single output



      Map               ----->
----> Map --->  Compute -----> Single output
      Map               ----->

-> These are Time Taking tasks

To overcome this drawback , we came up with spark architecture.

Spark--> Unified in memory operation (RDD)
Also contains HDFS

1. Driver Program: Coordinates tasks and manages job execution 
                 : Every compute occurs in RAM memory
                 : Processing time is reduced
2. Cluster Manager: Allocates resources ( Yarn , Kubernetes)

3. Executors : Worker Processors that execute tasks and cache data in the memory
-> Spark uses RDD( Resilient Distributed Databases) for fault tolerance in memory data storage



                         Hadoop(Disk Based)                   Vs                       Spark( RDD Based) 

Data Storage        Stored and Processed from disk                                   Stored temporarily in RAM

Results            Written to disk after after each stage                            Kept in memory untill needed

PErformance        Slower due to disk I/O                                            Faster in memory caching

Fault Tolerance   Replication Based


Data Governance and Security : Data Lineage , Data cataloging , MAsking and encryption

Data Quality and Testing : Validation , great expectation , unit testing

Data Visualization and Reporting : Power BI and Tableau 

Use flask and API for data delivery
