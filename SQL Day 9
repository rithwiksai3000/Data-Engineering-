CTE ( Common Table Expression)

with cte_name as (col names)
(
  select ---
  from ----
  where ----
)

We also write multiple CTE's 

Reusabality and Redability

Also need to write valiation script
Specific logic to verify the answer for the question

The scope of query (CTE) is at the query level.

But we want o use it at the session level. So to overcome this
We use a temporary table.
It only exists for the session or untill explictly dropped
Useful for storing intermediate results or testing transformations without affecying actual data

create temporary table sakila.table_name as 
select ----
from----
join---
join ----
group by ---
order by ----
limit---;

--> Now we can query tform this temp table

select *
from temp_table_name
and filters


Views : Virtual Tables
Will help simplifying complex queries , data abstraction and security
Helps with data secruity(abstraction)

create or replace view sakila.view_name as 


We use alias for orignal col names and only show the names which we define.
So it maintains confidentiality of the col names

The output if the view , the data is not stored , only the query is being stored
Data not being stored, only its schema is being stored

Subquery ---> CTE----> Temp Table ----> Views
(Evolution) 
Eg: Health care data or SSN info we use views
