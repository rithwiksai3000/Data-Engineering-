Raw Data -> Info : Data has a story to tell
We data engineers give voice to data.
Role : Understand the data and the story it tells.

Data Engineer : Involves bulding systems and pipelines to Collect , store and analyze large volumes of data for downstream.

ML: Learn data patterns
Pipelines: Devops and Data Governance
Governance : Dont put private data as public
Quality checks and Unit Checks
Devops : CI/CD

ETL : Extract Transform Load : Informatica , Data Stage


Data Engineering Life Cycle

1. Data Collection : Gather data from various sources
   Data Sources : Databases: Postgres , Mysql (structured) 
                : APIs : Rest Apis            (semi struct)
                : Files : CSV , Json , Xml    (Unstructured)

2. Ingestion : Moving data into centralized storage
   ETL / ELT : Pipelines : Parallel Processing Computation
   E: Store Raw Data into Warehouse
   L: Loading into DB
   T: Transform or apply business Rules

3. Processing : (1 gb - 100gb) , (1 day - 1 yr)

4. Storage : RDBMS , Data Lakes , Data Warehouse ( large storage units) 

5. Analysis

6. Consumption

ETL Pipeline Orchestration : Using Airflow to schedule and manage tasks.

CI/CD Pipelines: Using github actions



Data from Different Sources ---> Data Lake -(ETL)-> Curated Layer -(Spark)-> Warehouse ---> Reports 

Sub parts of Data warehouse is called data marts
